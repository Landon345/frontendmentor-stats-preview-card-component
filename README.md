## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to add a cool image with a nice purple overlay.
I was able to do it with this css.

```css
.img {
  border-radius: 10px 10px 0 0;
  background-image: url(./images/image-header-mobile.jpg);
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-size: cover;
  width: 100%;
  height: 60vw;
}

.layer {
  background-color: rgba(164, 19, 254, 0.4);
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  border-radius: 10px 10px 0 0;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to focus more on mobile first development to make nice, reponsive websites. I also want to incorporate more images into my websites.
